# TAP-Artificial-Intelligence-8-Puzzle-Solver
The 8 Puzzle Solver can be used to solve 8 Puzzle with efficient or minimum moves. It also allow to set goal state(Winning State/Puzzle ) and current state(Initial State/Puzzle) . The 8 Puzzle Solver uses A* algorithm with Heuristic function as Manhattan Distance and Misplaced Slides. 

Change Goal State in code manualy in static variable declaration of class in 1 dimention and 2 dimention array.
Change current state in solver method by passing values in initial (object) constructor.
The 1d to 2d array convertion  [ 0 = 0,0 ; 1 = 0,1 ; 2 = 0,2 ; 3 = 1,0 ; 4 = 1,1 ; 5 = 1,2 ; 6 = 2,0 ; 7 = 2,1 ; 8 = 2,2 ]
